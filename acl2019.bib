abstract = {Submodular maximization with the greedy algorithm has been studied as an effective approach to extractive summarization. This approach is known to have three advan-tages: its applicability to many useful sub-modular objective functions, the efficiency of the greedy algorithm, and the provable performance guarantee. However, when it comes to compressive summarization, we are currently missing a counterpart of the extractive method based on submodular-ity. In this paper, we propose a fast greedy method for compressive summarization. Our method is applicable to any mono-tone submodular objective function, includ-ing many functions well-suited for docu-ment summarization. We provide an ap-proximation guarantee of our greedy algo-rithm. Experiments show that our method is about 100 to 400 times faster than an existing method based on integer-linear-programming (ILP) formulations and that our method empirically achieves more than 95{\%}-approximation.},

@article{Pasunuru2018a,
abstract = {Abstractive text summarization is the task of compressing and rewriting a long document into a short summary while maintaining saliency, directed logical entailment, and non-redundancy. In this work, we address these three important aspects of a good summary via a reinforcement learning approach with two novel reward functions: ROUGESal and Entail, on top of a coverage-based baseline. The ROUGESal reward modifies the ROUGE metric by up-weighting the salient phrases/words detected via a keyphrase classifier. The Entail reward gives high (length-normalized) scores to logically-entailed summaries using an entailment classifier. Further, we show superior performance improvement when these rewards are combined with traditional metric (ROUGE) based rewards, via our novel and effective multi-reward approach of optimizing multiple rewards simultaneously in alternate mini-batches. Our method achieves the new state-of-the-art results (including human evaluation) on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset as well as strong improvements in a test-only transfer setup on DUC-2002.},

@article{Perrin2017,
abstract = {In neural abstractive summarization, the conventional sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model often suffers from repetition and semantic irrelevance. To tackle the problem, we propose a global encoding framework, which controls the information flow from the encoder to the decoder based on the global information of the source context. It consists of a convolutional gated unit to perform global encoding to improve the representations of the source-side information. Evaluations on the LCSTS and the English Gigaword both demonstrate that our model outperforms the baseline models, and the analysis shows that our model is capable of reducing repetition.},

abstract = {Summarizing a document requires identifying the important parts of the document with an objective of providing a quick overview to a reader. However, a long article can span sev-eral topics and a single summary cannot do justice to all the topics. Further, the interests of readers can vary and the notion of impor-tance can change across them. Existing sum-marization algorithms generate a single sum-mary and are not capable of generating mul-tiple summaries tuned to the interests of the readers. In this paper, we propose an attention based RNN framework to generate multiple summaries of a single document tuned to dif-ferent topics of interest. Our method outper-forms existing baselines and our results sug-gest that the attention of generative networks can be successfully biased to look at sentences relevant to a topic and effectively used to gen-erate topic-tuned summaries.},

Extractive summaries comprising a salient subset of input sentences, often also contain important key words. Guided by this principle, we design SWAP-NET that models the interaction of key words and salient sentences using a new two-level pointer network based architecture. SWAP-NET identifies both salient sentences and key words in an input document , and then combines them to form the extractive summary. Experiments on large scale benchmark corpora demonstrate the efficacy of SWAP-NET that outperforms state-of-the-art extractive summarizers.},

These results suggest that it is easier to create a summarizer for a new domain than previous work suggests and bring into question the benefit of deep learning models for summarization for those domains that do have massive datasets (i.e., news). At the same time, they suggest important questions for new research in summarization; namely, new forms of sentence representations or external knowledge sources are needed that are better suited to the sumarization task.},

abstract = {Generating an abstract from a collection of documents is a desirable capability for many real-world applications. However, abstractive approaches to multi-document summarization have not been thoroughly investigated. This paper studies the feasibility of using Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), a semantic representation of natural language grounded in linguistic theory, as a form of content representation. Our approach condenses source documents to a set of summary graphs following the AMR formalism. The summary graphs are then transformed to a set of summary sentences in a surface realization step. The framework is fully data-driven and flexible. Each component can be optimized independently using small-scale, in-domain training data. We perform experiments on benchmark summarization datasets and report promising results. We also describe opportunities and challenges for advancing this line of research.},

@article{Amplayo2018a,
abstract = {A major proportion of a text summary includes important entities found in the original text. These entities build up the topic of the summary. Moreover, they hold commonsense information once they are linked to a knowledge base. Based on these observations, this paper investigates the usage of linked entities to guide the decoder of a neural text summarizer to generate concise and better summaries. To this end, we leverage on an off-the-shelf entity linking system (ELS) to extract linked entities and propose Entity2Topic (E2T), a module easily attachable to a sequence-to-sequence model that transforms a list of entities into a vector representation of the topic of the summary. Current available ELS's are still not sufficiently effective, possibly introducing unresolved ambiguities and irrelevant entities. We resolve the imperfections of the ELS by (a) encoding entities with selective disambiguation, and (b) pooling entity vectors using firm attention. By applying E2T to a simple sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanism as base model, we see significant improvements of the performance in the Gigaword (sentence to title) and CNN (long document to multi-sentence highlights) summarization datasets by at least 2 ROUGE points.},

abstract = {Attentional, RNN-based encoder-decoder models for abstractive summarization have achieved good performance on short input and output sequences. However, for longer documents and summaries, these models often include repetitive and incoherent phrases. We introduce a neural network model with intra-attention and a new training method. This method combines standard supervised word prediction and reinforcement learning (RL). Models trained only with the former often exhibit "exposure bias" -- they assume ground truth is provided at each step during training. However, when standard word prediction is combined with the global sequence prediction training of RL the resulting summaries become more readable. We evaluate this model on the CNN/Daily Mail and New York Times datasets. Our model obtains a 41.16 ROUGE-1 score on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset, a 5.7 absolute points improvement over previous state-of-the-art models. It also performs well as the first abstractive model on the New York Times corpus. Human evaluation also shows that our model produces higher quality summaries.},

abstract = {Neural sequence-to-sequence models have provided a viable new approach for abstractive text summarization (meaning they are not restricted to simply selecting and rearranging passages from the original text). However, these models have two shortcomings: they are liable to reproduce factual details inaccurately, and they tend to repeat themselves. In this work we propose a novel architecture that augments the standard sequence-to-sequence attentional model in two orthogonal ways. First, we use a hybrid pointer-generator network that can copy words from the source text via pointing, which aids accurate reproduction of information, while retaining the ability to produce novel words through the generator. Second, we use coverage to keep track of what has been summarized, which discourages repetition. We apply our model to the CNN / Daily Mail summarization task, outperforming the current abstractive state-of-the-art by at least 2 ROUGE points.},

Afterwards we discuss kappavalues for both scoring models from several experiments conducted with humanannotators. Our results show that phrase-based evaluation can be used for fastevaluation obtaining significant agreement among annotators. The granularity ofranking choices should, however, not be too fine-grained as this seems toconfuse annotators and thus reduces the overall agreement.

Neural sequence-to-sequence models have gained considerable success for this task, while most existing approaches only focus on improving word overlap between the generated summary and the reference, which ignore the correctness, i.e., the summary should not contain error messages with respect to the source sentence. We argue that correctness is an essential requirement for summarization systems. Considering a correct summary is semantically entailed by the source sentence, we incorporate entailment knowledge into abstractive summarization models. We propose an entailment-aware encoder under multi-task framework (i.e., summarization generation and entailment recognition) and an entailment-aware decoder by entailment Reward Augmented Maximum Likelihood (RAML) training. Experimental results demonstrate that our models significantly outperform baselines from the aspects of informative-ness and correctness.},

abstract = {Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PPRibP) synthetase activity was studied in cultured fibroblasts and lymphoblasts from a male child (patient 2-A) in whom inherited purine nucleotide and uric acid overproduction are accompanied by neurological deficits. Chromatographed or partially purified preparations of the child's enzyme showed 5-6-fold increased inhibitory constants (I0.5) for the noncompetitive inhibitors GDP and 6-methylthioinosine monophosphate but normal responsiveness to the competitive inhibitors ADP and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. Activation of the PPRibP synthetase of patient 2-A by Piwas also abnormal with 3-4-fold reduced apparent KDvalues for Pi. Superactivity of the PPRibP synthetase of this child thus appeared to result from a combination of regulatory defects; selective resistance to noncompetitive inhibitors and increased responsiveness to Piactivation. Selective growth of the patient's fibroblasts in medium containing 6-methylthioinosine confirmed the functional significance of the in vitro inhibitor resistance of the aberrant enzyme. Fibroblasts and lymphoblasts derived from patient 2-A showed increased concentrations and rates of generation of PPRibP as well as increased rates of the pathways of purine base salvage and purine nucleotide synthesis de novo. The magnitudes of these increases in the child's cells exceeded those in cells with catalytically superactive PPRibP synthetases. These alterations as well as the in vitro kinetic abnormalities in the patient 2-A enzyme were expressed to a reduced degree in fibroblasts from the child's affected mother, supporting the proposal that this woman is a heterozygous carrier for X-linked enzyme superactivity. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

This work proposes a simple technique for addressing this issue: use a data-efficient content selector to over-determine phrases in a source document that should be part of the summary. We use this selector as a bottom-up attention step to constrain the model to likely phrases. We show that this approach improves the ability to compress text, while still generating fluent summaries. This two-step process is both simpler and higher performing than other end-to-end content selection models, leading to significant improvements on ROUGE for both the CNN-DM and NYT corpus. Furthermore, the content selector can be trained with as little as 1,000 sentences, making it easy to transfer a trained summarizer to a new domain.},

abstract = {Teaching machines to read natural language documents remains an elusive challenge. Machine reading systems can be tested on their ability to answer questions posed on the contents of documents that they have seen, but until now large scale training and test datasets have been missing for this type of evaluation. In this work we define a new methodology that resolves this bottleneck and provides large scale supervised reading comprehension data. This allows us to develop a class of attention based deep neural networks that learn to read real documents and answer complex questions with minimal prior knowledge of language structure.},
